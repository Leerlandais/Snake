        // For tomorrow : 
// Get the grid set up ---- (done)
// Pick some UNIQUE random spots for food (let's say 8, which once at 4 will always stay at 4)
// Make a square or a line of squares (the snake)
// Automate it's movement to always advance current direction (for the start, just from right to left) is square === free
// Set it to die if wall === true
// Figure out how to make it recognise key presses
// Figure out how to make the snake change direction (and bend while doing so)
// Figure out how to make snake bigger when foodInHeadEnd = true
// Everything else
